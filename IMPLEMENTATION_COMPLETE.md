## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User → /r/slug → backend/l.php
  ↓
  1. Validate link (active, not expired)
  2. Set vm_first_touch cookie (if new)
  3. Extract UTMs (querystring → referer)
  4. Find/create lead by cookie token
  5. Log click to link_clicks table
  6. Create queue_jobs entry
  7. If WhatsApp link: Generate deeplink with token
  8. Redirect to destination
  ↓
CRON runs scripts/worker.php every 5 minutes
  ↓
  1. Fetch pending jobs (next_run_at <= NOW)
  2. Process each job by type:
     - click → Send to GA4 + Meta (PageView)
     - conversion → Send to GA4 + Meta (Purchase)
     - whatsapp_message → Send to GA4 + Meta (Lead)
  3. On success: Mark completed
  4. On failure: Increment attempts, calculate backoff
  5. Log all activity to logs/worker.log
  ↓
Analytics platforms receive events
```

### Attribution Flow

```
First Touch:
User clicks ad → Lands on site → Cookie set (vm_first_touch: UUID)
  → Lead created with first_touch_token = UUID
  
Subsequent Interactions:
User clicks trackable link → Cookie read → Lead matched by token
User sends WhatsApp → Message contains "vm_token:UUID" → Lead matched
User completes payment → Metadata/cookie → Lead matched → Conversion created
  
Last Touch (implicit):
Latest interaction updates lead.last_seen and adds to touch points
```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check `DEPLOY_SUMMARY.txt` Section 14 (Troubleshooting)
2. Review logs:
   - `logs/worker.log`
   - `logs/app.log`
   - Hostinger error logs (via hPanel)
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test each component individually following Section 12

---

## 🏆 Success Metrics

Once deployed, monitor these metrics:

- **Click-through rate**: Clicks logged vs links created
- **Attribution rate**: Leads with first_touch_token vs total leads
- **Conversion rate**: Conversions vs leads
- **Event delivery**: Queue jobs completed vs created
- **System health**: Worker runs without errors, no failed jobs accumulating

---
