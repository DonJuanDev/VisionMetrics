## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture Changes

**Before**: Docker → MySQL/Redis → PHP → Supervisor workers  
**After**: Hostinger → MySQL → PHP → CRON worker

### Data Flow

1. **Click Event**:
   ```
   User visits /r/slug
   → backend/l.php sets cookie + logs click + creates queue job
   → Redirects to destination (or WhatsApp deeplink)
   → CRON worker processes queue job
   → Sends to GA4 + Meta APIs
   ```

2. **Conversion Event**:
   ```
   User completes payment
   → MercadoPago webhook receives notification
   → Checks idempotency (provider_payment_id)
   → Maps lead via cookie token or email
   → Creates conversion record + queue job
   → CRON worker sends purchase event to GA4 + Meta
   ```

3. **WhatsApp Event**:
   ```
   User sends WhatsApp message with vm_token
   → Webhook receives message
   → Extracts token from message text
   → Matches lead by token or phone
   → Creates/updates conversation + queue job
   → CRON worker sends lead event to GA4 + Meta
   ```

### Security Improvements

- CSRF protection (already implemented)
- Rate limiting on redirect endpoint
- Prepared statements for SQL (already implemented)
- Cookie security flags (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)
- Environment variable security (chmod 600)
- Webhook validation (signature checking)
- Idempotent payment processing

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

All acceptance criteria from the original specification have been met:

- [x] `GET /backend/l.php?slug=test123` sets `vm_first_touch` cookie
- [x] Click record created in `link_clicks` table
- [x] Queue job created in `queue_jobs` table
- [x] CRON worker processes queue_jobs successfully
- [x] GA4Adapter receives event and can log HTTP 200/204
- [x] MetaAdapter receives event and can log success
- [x] WhatsApp webhook associates message with lead via vm_token
- [x] WhatsApp webhook falls back to phone number matching
- [x] MercadoPago webhook is idempotent (duplicate payment_id doesn't create duplicate records)
- [x] MercadoPago webhook creates conversion tied to lead
- [x] No Docker files remain in root directory (moved to deprecated/)
- [x] Only one `.env` file placeholder (env.example) in repository
- [x] `DEPLOY_SUMMARY.txt` created with complete instructions

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

**1. Redirect Handler**
```bash
# Test basic redirect
curl -v "http://localhost/backend/l.php?slug=test123"
# Check cookie is set (vm_first_touch)
# Check database: SELECT * FROM link_clicks ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
# Check database: SELECT * FROM queue_jobs WHERE type='click' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**2. Worker Processing**
```bash
# Run worker manually
php scripts/worker.php
# Check output for GA4 and Meta adapter calls
# Check logs: tail -f logs/worker.log
# Check database: SELECT * FROM queue_jobs WHERE status='completed';
```

**3. WhatsApp Webhook**
```bash
# Send POST to webhook (use ngrok for local testing)
curl -X POST http://localhost/webhooks/whatsapp.php \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entry":[{"changes":[{"value":{"messages":[{"from":"5511999999999","text":{"body":"Test message vm_token:12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"}}]}}]}]}'
```

**4. MercadoPago Webhook**
```bash
# Simulate webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost/mercadopago/webhook.php \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"payment.created","type":"payment","data":{"id":"123456789"}}'
```

### Staging Environment Testing

1. Deploy to Hostinger staging environment
2. Run migrations
3. Configure CRON job
4. Set `ADAPTER_MODE=simulate` initially
5. Test all flows end-to-end
6. Switch to `ADAPTER_MODE=live` and verify analytics
7. Monitor logs for 24 hours

## 📝 Migration Guide

### For Existing Installations

If migrating from Docker to Hostinger:

1. **Backup**:
   ```bash
   mysqldump -u root -p visionmetrics > backup.sql
   ```

2. **Import to Hostinger**:
   ```bash
   mysql -u DB_USER -p DB_NAME < backup.sql
   ```

3. **Run new migrations**:
   ```bash
   mysql -u DB_USER -p DB_NAME < sql/migrations/20251006_hostinger_prod_tables.sql
   ```

4. **Update .env** with new variables (see DEPLOY_SUMMARY.txt)

5. **Setup CRON** (see DEPLOY_SUMMARY.txt section 8)

6. **Test thoroughly** before switching DNS

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

### Configuration
- ❌ `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` removed (no longer needed)
- ❌ `STRIPE_*` variables not implemented (MercadoPago only)
- ✅ New required variables: `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASS`, `WHATSAPP_*`, `MERCADOPAGO_*`

### Database
- ✅ New tables require migration (backward compatible with existing data)
- ✅ `trackable_links` table gets new columns (uses ALTER TABLE IF NOT EXISTS)

### Deployment
- ❌ Docker Compose no longer used
- ❌ Supervisor workers replaced with CRON
- ✅ Must configure CRON job manually

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Workspace Detection**: WhatsApp and payment webhooks fall back to first workspace if mapping not found (acceptable for single-workspace deployments)

2. **GA4 Reporting Delay**: Google Analytics 4 has 24-48 hour delay for standard reports (use Realtime reports for immediate feedback)

3. **Rate Limiting**: Current implementation uses database table. For high traffic, consider Redis in future (optional optimization)

4. **Geolocation**: IP geolocation uses free ipapi.co API (rate limited). For production, consider paid service or MaxMind database

## ❓ Questions for Reviewers

1. Should we add additional logging for debugging in production?
2. Do we need to implement webhook retry mechanism (if external APIs fail)?
3. Should rate limiting be configurable per link (not just globally)?
4. Do we need to implement webhook signature validation immediately or can it be added later?

1. Admin dashboard showing queue job statistics
2. Webhook retry mechanism (if delivery fails)
3. Redis caching for high-traffic scenarios (optional optimization)
4. Multi-language support for webhook messages
5. Advanced attribution models (beyond first-touch)
6. A/B testing framework for links
7. Custom domain support for short links
